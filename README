Class::Proxy::Lite
==================

Simple, lightweight implementation of object proxies.

All methods are delegated to a target object, but no reference
to the target object is kept.  Instead, a user-supplied token
(any kind of data) and resolver (a function to convert the token
into an object reference) are used to identify the target object
each time a method is called on the proxy.

In order to avoid method name clashes, the only method defined
in this class is AUTOLOAD.

This class is not related to Class::Proxy by Murat Uenalan.

See the module documentation for more information.
